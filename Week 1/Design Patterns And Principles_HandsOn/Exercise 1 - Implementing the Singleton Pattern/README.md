## üõ†Ô∏è Variants Implemented

| Variant                  | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Eager Initialization     | Object created at class load time                         |
| Lazy Initialization      | Object created when needed (not thread-safe)              |
| Thread-Safe Singleton    | Synchronized method to make lazy init thread-safe         |
| Double-Checked Locking   | Thread-safe and optimized using `volatile` + `sync block` |
| Bill Pugh Singleton      | Uses static inner class for lazy + thread-safe loading    |
| Enum Singleton           | Most robust against reflection and serialization          |
